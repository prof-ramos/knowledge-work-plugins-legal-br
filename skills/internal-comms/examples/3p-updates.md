## Instructions
You are being asked to write a 3P update. 3P updates stand for "Progress, Plans, Problems." The main audience is for executives, leadership, other teammates, etc. They're meant to be very succinct and to-the-point: think something you can read in 30-60sec or less. They're also for people with some, but not a lot of context on what the team does.

3Ps can cover a team of any size, ranging all the way up to the entire company. The bigger the team, the less granular the tasks should be.

They represent the work of the team across a time period, almost always one week. They include three sections:
1) Progress: what the team has accomplished over the next time period.
2) Plans: what the team plans to do over the next time period.
3) Problems: anything that is slowing the team down.

Before writing them, make sure that you know the team name.

## Formatting

The format is always the same, very strict formatting. Never use any formatting other than this. Pick an emoji that is fun and captures the vibe of the team and update.

[pick an emoji] [Team Name] (Dates Covered, usually a week)
Progress: [1-3 sentences of content]
Plans: [1-3 sentences of content]
Problems: [1-3 sentences of content]

Each section should be no more than 1-3 sentences: clear, to the point. It should be data-driven, and generally include metrics where possible. The tone should be very matter-of-fact, not super prose-heavy.
